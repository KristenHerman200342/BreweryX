BreweryX is an actively maintained fork of Brewery which includes many new features, bug fixes and gives support to the inactive plugin!

This Plugin works with **Spigot**, **Paper**, and **Folia** for 1.21 - 1.8.x.

## What is BreweryX?

The somewhat difficult brewing process rewards you with a diversity of Potions, which, through their effects, create a drunkeness that has never existed in Minecraft before.

Learn the art of brewing through fermenting, distilling and barrel aging on your Minecraft server. Experience how from spring water and wheat, through hard work, a cool beer is created. Distill high-proof liquor, which gets that unique taste after some aging in oak barrels.
Celebrate the biggest feasts you can imagine and always keep the cheerful atmosphere. Fill the taverns with laughter and loud music, while the drunkards scuffle on the streets.

## Why Brewery*X*?

Original Brewery is **decade** old with no support, so we took this plugin into our hands and added new features and fixed some critical bugs:

- Patches like [this](https://github.com/DieReicheErethons/Brewery/issues/541)

- Support for Brewery and BreweryX in our discord

- [Folia](https://github.com/PaperMC/Folia) support

- Customizable plugin prefix

- Full RGB support for 1.16+
